# Packet Defender: An Educational Web-Based Network Game (v2.0)

**A single-file HTML/JavaScript game designed by Wes Fryer and collaboratively "vibecoded" with Gemini, the AI assistant.**

Packet Defender is a fast-paced, educational, single-player game created to help middle school students understand fundamental networking and cybersecurity concepts through interactive gameplay.

## üéì Educational Goals

The core objective is to gamify essential Internet terminology and processes:

* **IP Addressing:** Students must correctly identify and enter IP addresses for successful transmission.
* **DNS Resolution:** Every packet displays a **Domain Name**, requiring the student to look up the corresponding **IP Address** using the on-screen DNS Lookup Table.
* **Packet Transmission (Routing):** Players match packet details (Origin IP, Name, Destination IP) to successfully route the data.
* **Cybersecurity Defense:** Students must identify "under attack" packets (colored red) and use the **Defend Server** action to earn higher points, simulating a firewall or mitigation response.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Features

* **Single-File Deployment:** The entire game runs from a single HTML file (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript contained within), making deployment instant.
* **Difficulty Modes:** Students can select Easy (60s refresh), Intermediate (45s refresh), or Hard (30s refresh) timers.
* **Overall Game Timer:** A 5-minute timer encourages competitive play and score tracking against classmates.
* **Persistent Score:** The player's score is saved in their browser's local storage and persists across page reloads until they choose to restart the game.
* **Visual Feedback:** Includes colorful packet queuing, a visible countdown, and a simple ASCII animation upon successful action.
